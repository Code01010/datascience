    "The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of news articles in two ways:\n",
    "1. Parsing names and dates from each article in a useable format.\n",
    "2. Applying text analytics to identify 5 news articles from the dataset that are most similar to a given sample article.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is an assessment given by Deloitte for potential Natural Language Processing work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing and processing the data, I determined that a Sentence Embedding model was the most accurate at predicting document similarity. A TF-IDF model and a model utilizing Spacy's internal similarity tools were far less performant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final output of this project, I have created two files:\n",
    "* 'texts_processed.csv': a final csv file of all relevant information, including the columns of names, distinct names, dates and datetime objects.\n",
    "* 'closest_matches.csv': a sampling of the top five articles in similarity to the sample article, using the Sentence Embedding method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Future Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "With more time to devote to this project, there are several changes that could improve accuracy:\n",
    "* Experimenting with various Spacy models, especially for vectorization/similarity testing.\n",
    "* Training a custom model/class to detect document similarity utilizing the spacy or flair library.\n",
    "* Utilizing Spark to increase compute power and decrease run time for text/date classification.\n",

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".</td>\n",

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said.

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".   \n",

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.   \n",

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".</td>\n",

Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said.

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".   \n",

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.   \n",

Two people were injured,\" Fars said.  It did not explain the exact circumstances.  Iranian riot police used teargas elsewhere in Tehran to disperse demonstrators protesting against a disputed presidential election, a witness said. (Editing by Jon Boyle)   \n",
       "4   Tehran - Iran's Guardian Council is ready to recount up to 10 percent of the ballot boxes randomly in last week's presidential election, state television reported on Saturday. \"The Guardian Council is ready to recount randomly up to 10 percent of ballot boxes in last week's disputed presidential election,\" the council's spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodai was quoted as saying. \"The Guardian Council is not legally obliged,\" Kadkhodai said, \"we will recount the votes in the presence of the three (defeated) candidates.\" Whenever the examination and the recount is finished the council will announce its final decision, he added. He also said that Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi still have time to express their opinions until Wednesday. Only Iran's former Revolutionary Guards Chief Mohsen Rezaei attended a special meeting of the Guardians Council with presidential candidates on Saturday, the official IRNA news agency reported. Iran's former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and former Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi failed to attend the meeting without giving any reason. The Spokesman of the Guardian Council Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei said on Wednesday that candidates of Iran's recent presidential election were invited to its upcoming meeting session which is to be held within the next few days. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has ordered Iran's Guardian Council, the top legislative body, to investigate the claims of \"fraud\" in the recent presidential election.   \n",

Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said.

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".   \n",

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".</td>\n",

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.</td>\n",

The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a \"blacklist\" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry \"a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people\".   \n",

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. \"Mel was really important to Ed,\" an agency source said. \"He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son.\" But he added, \"The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion.\" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. \"I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,\" one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.   \n",

Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.</td>\n",

Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. \"The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings.\" Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, \"Down with the regime\" and \"Get out Muammar Gaddafi.\" Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon \"nationalist youth\" to go out and \"defend national symbols.\" At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.</td>\n",

Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.</td>\n",

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. \"I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu,\" Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as \"stable\", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.</td>\n",

The group has documented the deaths of 297 people, but says the final toll is likely to be significantly higher. Human Rights Watch says the vast majority of the deaths in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez were on January 28 and 29 as a result of live gunfire as riot police fought running battles with protesters. A significant proportion came as a result of rubber bullets fired at too close a range and from teargas canisters fired into the crowds at very close range. Human Rights Watch says the actual number of deaths is likely to be an underestimate because the organisation had only included those deaths it had verified itself at key hospitals in the three major cities.   \n",

Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.   \n",
       "2624   The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent. Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. \"The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings.\" Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, \"Down with the regime\" and \"Get out Muammar Gaddafi.\" Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon \"nationalist youth\" to go out and \"defend national symbols.\" At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.   \n",

Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.   \n",

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. \"I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu,\" Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as \"stable\", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.   \n",

       "      <td>Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability. Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.</td>\n",

Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. \"The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings.\" Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, \"Down with the regime\" and \"Get out Muammar Gaddafi.\" Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon \"nationalist youth\" to go out and \"defend national symbols.\" At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Flu viruses which target man tend to attach to cells further up the airway - maximising their chances of being passed on by coughing or sneezing. Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.</td>\n",

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. \"I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu,\" Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as \"stable\", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The U.N. Human Rights Council decried a wide range of human rights violations in Syria on Friday and called for U.N. bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take\" appropriate action.\" The council passed a resolution that \"strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children.\" There were 37 yes votes, four against and six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a troubling report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces \"committed crimes against humanity\" against civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies \"urgently consider\" the commission report and \"take appropriate action.\" The group decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \"for appropriate action and transmission to all U.N. relevant bodies.\" It backs \"efforts to protect the population of the Syrian Arab Republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations.\" And, it urged Syria \"to protect its population\" and \"to immediately put an end to all human rights violations.\" The resolution also decided \"to establish a mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria and urges Syria to cooperate with it. Before the resolution was adopted, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the council Syria faces a \"full-fledged civil war\" if the regime's \"continual ruthless repression\" against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isn't stopped now. She noted with concern the reports of \"increased armed attacks by the opposition forces, including the so-called Free Syrian army, against the Syrian military and security apparatus.\" \"In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people,\" Pillay said.</td>\n",

Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.   \n",
       "2624   The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent. Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. \"The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings.\" Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, \"Down with the regime\" and \"Get out Muammar Gaddafi.\" Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon \"nationalist youth\" to go out and \"defend national symbols.\" At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.   \n",

Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.   \n",

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. \"I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu,\" Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as \"stable\", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.   \n",

Human Rights Council decried a wide range of human rights violations in Syria on Friday and called for U.N. bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take\" appropriate action.\" The council passed a resolution that \"strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children.\" There were 37 yes votes, four against and six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a troubling report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces \"committed crimes against humanity\" against civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies \"urgently consider\" the commission report and \"take appropriate action.\" The group decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \"for appropriate action and transmission to all U.N. relevant bodies.\" It backs \"efforts to protect the population of the Syrian Arab Republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations.\" And, it urged Syria \"to protect its population\" and \"to immediately put an end to all human rights violations.\" The resolution also decided \"to establish a mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria and urges Syria to cooperate with it. Before the resolution was adopted, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the council Syria faces a \"full-fledged civil war\" if the regime's \"continual ruthless repression\" against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isn't stopped now. She noted with concern the reports of \"increased armed attacks by the opposition forces, including the so-called Free Syrian army, against the Syrian military and security apparatus.\" \"In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people,\" Pillay said.   \n",

    "         Human Rights Watch says government-controlled health services in Egypt have been pressured into playing down the number of casualties during anti-government protests. The group has documented the deaths of 297 people, but says the final toll is likely to be significantly higher. Human Rights Watch says the vast majority of the deaths in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez were on January 28 and 29 as a result of live gunfire as riot police fought running battles with protesters. A significant proportion came as a result of rubber bullets fired at too close a range and from teargas canisters fired into the crowds at very close range. Human Rights Watch says the actual number of deaths is likely to be an underestimate because the organisation had only included those deaths it had verified itself at key hospitals in the three major cities.\n",

The two killed were shot by police trying to disperse angry crowds in the city of Suez, medical officials said. In the capital Cairo, thousands of protesters remained on the streets following a day of clashes with police. Thousands marched to the interior ministry, where security forces fired tear gas to keep them back. Earlier, the Egyptian prime minister announced the sackings of several senior officials. Funerals of some of the 74 victims took place in Port Said, where the football match had taken place on Wednesday. The deaths came when fans invaded the pitch after a fixture between top Cairo club al-Ahly and the Port Said side al-Masry. As night fell in Cairo, several thousand demonstrators remained in the streets around the interior ministry, witnesses said. In Suez, health official Mohammed Lasheen said two people had been shot dead early on Friday.

Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.</td>\n",

Many others were wounded in the clashes between security forces and protesters, the US-based Human Rights Watch said. Protests continued overnight with thousands on the streets of the eastern city of Benghazi, where there is now a heavy military presence, witnesses said. Large protests are uncommon in Libya, where dissent is rarely allowed. Pro-democracy protests have recently swept through several Arab nations, with the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt forced from power amid growing unrest. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says violent confrontations are reported to have spread to five Libyan cities in demonstrations so far, but not yet to Tripoli, the capital, in any large numbers. Our correspondent says the reports reflect an extremely tough government response, including the use of gunfire and even denying supplies to hospitals. Funerals of some of those killed are expected to be held on Friday in Benghazi and al-Bayda, which correspondents say could spur more protests. Activists set up camps in al-Bayda after Thursday's \"Day of Rage\" protest against the government, witnesses said.

       "      <td>(CNN) -- Yemeni protesters and military and pro-government gangs clashed in several areas Tuesday, with at least six killed and hundreds more injured, as the future of President Ali Abdullah Saleh remained uncertain. The United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the \"real threat\" from al Qaeda in the country, he said. In Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base. Four people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said. \"The government forces are killing us,\" said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. \"Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts.\" In the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds. The security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators. \"Security forces did not attack protesters,\" said Abdullah Qiaran. \"We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing.\" An estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said. The violence comes as the United States is helping to mediate a transition out of office for Saleh, who has been facing popular protests for weeks, according to two Yemeni officials.</td>\n",

       "      <td>1 of 13. Anti-government protesters run after police fired tear gas during a demonstration in the southern Yemeni city of Taiz April 4, 2011. The attempt to suppress mounting protests inspired by uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia came amid signs that the United States is seeking an end to Saleh's 32-year rule, long seen as a rampart against Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In Taiz, south of the capital Sanaa, police shot at protesters trying to storm the provincial government building, killing at least 15 and wounding 30, hospital doctors said. \"The regime has surprised us with this extent of killing. I don't think the people will do anything other than come out with bare chests to drain the government of all its ammunition,\" parliamentarian Mohammed Muqbil al-Hamiri told Al Jazeera TV. The television showed a row of men, apparent tear gas victims, lying motionless and being tended by medics on the carpeted floor of a makeshift hospital in Taiz. In the Red Sea port of Hudaida, police and armed men in civilian clothes attacked a march toward a presidential palace. Three people were hit by bullets, around 30 were stabbed with knifes, and 270 were hurt from inhaling tear gas, doctors said. Later on Monday, doctors said at least six demonstrators were shot dead and several wounded during evening rallies, and that the toll was likely to rise. In Washington, the U.S. State Department called the latest violence in Yemen \"appalling.\" Yemen's opposition coalition appealed in a statement to the United Nations, human rights groups and other international bodies \"to intervene quickly to stop President Saleh and his entourage from shedding more blood.\" As opposition forces stepped up their actions, Saleh again appeared defiant.</td>\n",

The two killed were shot by police trying to disperse angry crowds in the city of Suez, medical officials said. In the capital Cairo, thousands of protesters remained on the streets following a day of clashes with police. Thousands marched to the interior ministry, where security forces fired tear gas to keep them back. Earlier, the Egyptian prime minister announced the sackings of several senior officials. Funerals of some of the 74 victims took place in Port Said, where the football match had taken place on Wednesday. The deaths came when fans invaded the pitch after a fixture between top Cairo club al-Ahly and the Port Said side al-Masry. As night fell in Cairo, several thousand demonstrators remained in the streets around the interior ministry, witnesses said. In Suez, health official Mohammed Lasheen said two people had been shot dead early on Friday. A witness quoted by Reuters said: \"Protesters are trying to break into the Suez police station and police are now firing live ammunition.\"   \n",
       "1     Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability. Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. \"Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,\" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.\" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, \"We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before.\" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.   \n",

Many others were wounded in the clashes between security forces and protesters, the US-based Human Rights Watch said. Protests continued overnight with thousands on the streets of the eastern city of Benghazi, where there is now a heavy military presence, witnesses said. Large protests are uncommon in Libya, where dissent is rarely allowed. Pro-democracy protests have recently swept through several Arab nations, with the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt forced from power amid growing unrest. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says violent confrontations are reported to have spread to five Libyan cities in demonstrations so far, but not yet to Tripoli, the capital, in any large numbers. Our correspondent says the reports reflect an extremely tough government response, including the use of gunfire and even denying supplies to hospitals. Funerals of some of those killed are expected to be held on Friday in Benghazi and al-Bayda, which correspondents say could spur more protests. Activists set up camps in al-Bayda after Thursday's \"Day of Rage\" protest against the government, witnesses said. Eyewitnesses believe that the death toll could be even higher, our correspondent says.   \n",

The United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the \"real threat\" from al Qaeda in the country, he said. In Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base. Four people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said. \"The government forces are killing us,\" said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. \"Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts.\" In the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds. The security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators. \"Security forces did not attack protesters,\" said Abdullah Qiaran. \"We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing.\" An estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said. The violence comes as the United States is helping to mediate a transition out of office for Saleh, who has been facing popular protests for weeks, according to two Yemeni officials.   \n",

Anti-government protesters run after police fired tear gas during a demonstration in the southern Yemeni city of Taiz April 4, 2011. The attempt to suppress mounting protests inspired by uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia came amid signs that the United States is seeking an end to Saleh's 32-year rule, long seen as a rampart against Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In Taiz, south of the capital Sanaa, police shot at protesters trying to storm the provincial government building, killing at least 15 and wounding 30, hospital doctors said. \"The regime has surprised us with this extent of killing. I don't think the people will do anything other than come out with bare chests to drain the government of all its ammunition,\" parliamentarian Mohammed Muqbil al-Hamiri told Al Jazeera TV. The television showed a row of men, apparent tear gas victims, lying motionless and being tended by medics on the carpeted floor of a makeshift hospital in Taiz. In the Red Sea port of Hudaida, police and armed men in civilian clothes attacked a march toward a presidential palace. Three people were hit by bullets, around 30 were stabbed with knifes, and 270 were hurt from inhaling tear gas, doctors said. Later on Monday, doctors said at least six demonstrators were shot dead and several wounded during evening rallies, and that the toll was likely to rise. In Washington, the U.S. State Department called the latest violence in Yemen \"appalling.\" Yemen's opposition coalition appealed in a statement to the United Nations, human rights groups and other international bodies \"to intervene quickly to stop President Saleh and his entourage from shedding more blood.\" As opposition forces stepped up their actions, Saleh again appeared defiant.   \n",

    "             Human Rights Watch says government-controlled health services in Egypt have been pressured into playing down the number of casualties during anti-government protests. The group has documented the deaths of 297 people, but says the final toll is likely to be significantly higher. Human Rights Watch says the vast majority of the deaths in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez were on January 28 and 29 as a result of live gunfire as riot police fought running battles with protesters. A significant proportion came as a result of rubber bullets fired at too close a range and from teargas canisters fired into the crowds at very close range. Human Rights Watch says the actual number of deaths is likely to be an underestimate because the organisation had only included those deaths it had verified itself at key hospitals in the three major cities.\n",

They often fail to detonate immediately and may explode years after a conflict, killing or maiming people, according to humanitarian groups. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that government forces had fired cluster munitions into residential areas in the western city of Misrata, \"posing a grave risk to civilians\". The group said it had observed at least three such weapons explode over the coastal city's el-Shawahda neighbourhood on the night of April 14. \"Researchers inspected the remnants of a cluster submunition and interviewed witnesses to two other apparent cluster munition strikes,\" it said on its website, which also had photographs of what it said were the remnants of the munitions used in Misrata. \"They pose a huge risk to civilians, both during attacks because of their indiscriminate nature and afterward because of the still-dangerous unexploded duds scattered about,\" he said. Based on a submunition first discovered by a New York Times reporter and inspected by Human Rights Watch, the group said the cluster munition was a Spanish-produced MAT-120 120 mm mortar projectile, which it said opens in mid-air and releases 21 submunitions over a wide area. It said it had not yet been able to determine if civilians in Misrata had been wounded or killed by such munitions. A rebel spokesman in Misrata, the insurgents' last major enclave in western Libya, also told Reuters cluster munitions had been used by pro-government forces there. \"To use these bombs, the evidence would remain for days and weeks, and we know the international community is coming en masse to our country soon, so we can't do this.\" Libya has invited UNICEF to visit Misrata and on Saturday a Red Crescent and Red Cross team will go there, he said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A row has been rumbling since the strikes in early May   Failure by US forces to follow their own rules was the \"likely\" cause of civilian deaths in Afghan airstrikes last month, a US military report says. US officials looked at seven strikes on Taliban targets in Farah province on 4 May, and concluded that three had not complied with military guidelines. The report accepts that at least 26 civilians died, but acknowledges that the real figure could be much higher. The Afghan government has said 140 civilians were killed in the strikes. Washington and Kabul have been at loggerheads for weeks over the number of civilians killed in the incident. The report's conclusions are couched in caveats, but by releasing it late on a Friday afternoon the Pentagon has underlined its embarrassment at what may be the worst case of civilian deaths since coalition forces entered the country in 2001. As well as acknowledging that there was a failure to follow strict military guidelines, the report recommends unspecified steps to be taken to refine that guidance and urges a greater engagement in the public relations battle.   It states that the coalition should be \"first with the truth\". Yet the report also calls into question whether the true number of civilian deaths, in this incident, will ever be known. It sticks with the US military's initial estimate of 26, but describes a report by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, which speaks of at least 86 civilian casualties, as \"balanced\" and \"thorough\". The US report defends the Farah operation, saying the use of force \"was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat\". \"However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimise accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties,\" the report says. It says the final three strikes of the engagement, which took place after dark, did not adhere to \"specific guidance\" in the controlling directive. \"Not applying all of that guidance likely resulted in civilian casualties,\" the report says. It concedes that the precise number of civilians killed in the attack may never be known because many victims were buried before the investigation started. The document makes a number of recommendations to reduce the likelihood of civilian deaths. It says lines of communication must be improved, new guidelines should be introduced and personnel need to be retrained. Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US commander in Afghanistan, is currently reviewing US rules in relation to airstrikes. He said last month that US forces should use them only if the lives of Nato personnel or American troops were clearly at risk. Both Nato and US have have insisted that avoiding civilian casualties is their priority in all battles.</td>\n",

Unofficial estimates of civilian deaths had varied from 10,000 to over 37,000. The Lancet admits the research is based on a small sample - under 1,000 homes - but says the findings are \"convincing\". Responding to the Lancet article, a Pentagon spokesman defended coalition action in Iraq. \"This conflict has been prosecuted in the most precise fashion of any conflict in the history of modern warfare\", he said. UK foreign secretary Jack Straw said his government would examine the findings \"with very great care\". But he told BBC's Today that another independent estimate of civilian deaths was around 15,000. The Iraq Body Count, a respected database run by a group of academics and peace activists, has put the number of reported civilian deaths at between 14,000-16,000. The Lancet published research by scientists from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US city of Baltimore. They gathered data on births and deaths since January 2002 from 33 clusters of 30 households each across Iraq.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Typhoon Haiyan, the most powerful storm to make landfall this year, struck the central Philippines on November 8, killing more than 5,200 people, displacing 4.4 million and destroying an estimated 12 billion pesos ($274 million) worth of crops and infrastructure. The U.S. Navy has pulled out its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, but still has ten C-130 aircraft delivering relief supplies. Last week, the United States had 50 ships and aircraft in the disaster zone. Jeremy Konyndyk, director for Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said the U.S. military had started to reduce its presence to allow civilian aid agencies to step up efforts. \"What we have seen, particularly over the past week, is now civilian and private-sector commercial capacity has started coming back up again and that is taking the burden off of the military actors,\" Konyndyk told Reuters in an interview. \"You don't want the military playing that role in the long run, they are an interim bridging capacity there, but in the long run, that really needs to be civilian role.\" Konyndyk said there had been significant progress in meeting people's basic needs as more roads and ports opened in the worst-hit Leyte and Samar islands. \"Food has been distributed to 3 million people, shelter kits have been delivered to tens of thousands of families. I think the situation with immediate humanitarian needs is becoming stabilized.\" Aid delivery was gathering pace as access to affected areas improved, the U.N. humanitarian office said it its latest report. However, major issues remained including the distribution of food and access to clean water and shelter material. Konyndyk said the next step was for USAID and other international aid agencies to refocus their efforts on long-term recovery and reconstruction, giving priority to shelter and livelihoods for farmers and fishermen. The United States has increased its typhoon aid to nearly $52 million, but latest estimates from the United Nations showed the disaster rehabilitation plan would cost $348 million. Only 38 percent of the plan is funded.</td>\n",

They often fail to detonate immediately and may explode years after a conflict, killing or maiming people, according to humanitarian groups. Human Rights Watch said in a statement that government forces had fired cluster munitions into residential areas in the western city of Misrata, \"posing a grave risk to civilians\". The group said it had observed at least three such weapons explode over the coastal city's el-Shawahda neighbourhood on the night of April 14. \"Researchers inspected the remnants of a cluster submunition and interviewed witnesses to two other apparent cluster munition strikes,\" it said on its website, which also had photographs of what it said were the remnants of the munitions used in Misrata. \"They pose a huge risk to civilians, both during attacks because of their indiscriminate nature and afterward because of the still-dangerous unexploded duds scattered about,\" he said. Based on a submunition first discovered by a New York Times reporter and inspected by Human Rights Watch, the group said the cluster munition was a Spanish-produced MAT-120 120 mm mortar projectile, which it said opens in mid-air and releases 21 submunitions over a wide area. It said it had not yet been able to determine if civilians in Misrata had been wounded or killed by such munitions. A rebel spokesman in Misrata, the insurgents' last major enclave in western Libya, also told Reuters cluster munitions had been used by pro-government forces there. \"To use these bombs, the evidence would remain for days and weeks, and we know the international community is coming en masse to our country soon, so we can't do this.\" Libya has invited UNICEF to visit Misrata and on Saturday a Red Crescent and Red Cross team will go there, he said.   \n",
       "53     A row has been rumbling since the strikes in early May   Failure by US forces to follow their own rules was the \"likely\" cause of civilian deaths in Afghan airstrikes last month, a US military report says. US officials looked at seven strikes on Taliban targets in Farah province on 4 May, and concluded that three had not complied with military guidelines. The report accepts that at least 26 civilians died, but acknowledges that the real figure could be much higher. The Afghan government has said 140 civilians were killed in the strikes. Washington and Kabul have been at loggerheads for weeks over the number of civilians killed in the incident. The report's conclusions are couched in caveats, but by releasing it late on a Friday afternoon the Pentagon has underlined its embarrassment at what may be the worst case of civilian deaths since coalition forces entered the country in 2001. As well as acknowledging that there was a failure to follow strict military guidelines, the report recommends unspecified steps to be taken to refine that guidance and urges a greater engagement in the public relations battle.   It states that the coalition should be \"first with the truth\". Yet the report also calls into question whether the true number of civilian deaths, in this incident, will ever be known. It sticks with the US military's initial estimate of 26, but describes a report by the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, which speaks of at least 86 civilian casualties, as \"balanced\" and \"thorough\". The US report defends the Farah operation, saying the use of force \"was an appropriate means to destroy that enemy threat\". \"However, the inability to discern the presence of civilians and avoid and/or minimise accompanying collateral damage resulted in the unintended consequence of civilian casualties,\" the report says. It says the final three strikes of the engagement, which took place after dark, did not adhere to \"specific guidance\" in the controlling directive. \"Not applying all of that guidance likely resulted in civilian casualties,\" the report says. It concedes that the precise number of civilians killed in the attack may never be known because many victims were buried before the investigation started. The document makes a number of recommendations to reduce the likelihood of civilian deaths. It says lines of communication must be improved, new guidelines should be introduced and personnel need to be retrained. Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US commander in Afghanistan, is currently reviewing US rules in relation to airstrikes. He said last month that US forces should use them only if the lives of Nato personnel or American troops were clearly at risk. Both Nato and US have have insisted that avoiding civilian casualties is their priority in all battles.   \n",

The report's findings are expected to be even graver than in Dublin and Ferns. Last night sources indicated that the Cabinet will approve the 400-page report of the Murphy Commission of Inquiry, and order its immediate publication tomorrow. Preparations were last night being made to allow victims and the media to read in advance the detailed 26 chapters of abuse complaints against 19 priests over a 13-year period from January 1 1996 to 2009. \"An hour has been allocated for a pre-publication read ahead of a news conference which Mr Shatter is planning to hold at midday,\" a source said last night. The report is said to be damning of former Bishop John Magee's failures to implement agreed child protection procedures.But it likely to highlight the failure of the gardai and health services in dealing with a number of abuse complaints.   \n",

Unofficial estimates of civilian deaths had varied from 10,000 to over 37,000. The Lancet admits the research is based on a small sample - under 1,000 homes - but says the findings are \"convincing\". Responding to the Lancet article, a Pentagon spokesman defended coalition action in Iraq. \"This conflict has been prosecuted in the most precise fashion of any conflict in the history of modern warfare\", he said. UK foreign secretary Jack Straw said his government would examine the findings \"with very great care\". But he told BBC's Today that another independent estimate of civilian deaths was around 15,000. The Iraq Body Count, a respected database run by a group of academics and peace activists, has put the number of reported civilian deaths at between 14,000-16,000. The Lancet published research by scientists from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in the US city of Baltimore. They gathered data on births and deaths since January 2002 from 33 clusters of 30 households each across Iraq.   \n",

The U.S. Navy has pulled out its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington, but still has ten C-130 aircraft delivering relief supplies. Last week, the United States had 50 ships and aircraft in the disaster zone. Jeremy Konyndyk, director for Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), said the U.S. military had started to reduce its presence to allow civilian aid agencies to step up efforts. \"What we have seen, particularly over the past week, is now civilian and private-sector commercial capacity has started coming back up again and that is taking the burden off of the military actors,\" Konyndyk told Reuters in an interview. \"You don't want the military playing that role in the long run, they are an interim bridging capacity there, but in the long run, that really needs to be civilian role.\" Konyndyk said there had been significant progress in meeting people's basic needs as more roads and ports opened in the worst-hit Leyte and Samar islands. \"Food has been distributed to 3 million people, shelter kits have been delivered to tens of thousands of families. I think the situation with immediate humanitarian needs is becoming stabilized.\" Aid delivery was gathering pace as access to affected areas improved, the U.N. humanitarian office said it its latest report. However, major issues remained including the distribution of food and access to clean water and shelter material. Konyndyk said the next step was for USAID and other international aid agencies to refocus their efforts on long-term recovery and reconstruction, giving priority to shelter and livelihoods for farmers and fishermen. The United States has increased its typhoon aid to nearly $52 million, but latest estimates from the United Nations showed the disaster rehabilitation plan would cost $348 million. Only 38 percent of the plan is funded.   \n",
