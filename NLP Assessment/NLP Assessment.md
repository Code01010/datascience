# NLP Assessment

The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset of news articles in two ways:
1. Parsing names and dates from each article in a useable format.
2. Applying text analytics to identify 5 news articles from the dataset that are most similar to a given sample article.

This project is an assessment given by Deloitte for potential Natural Language Processing work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

# Summary of Reults

After analyzing and processing the data, I determined that a Sentence Embedding model was the most accurate at predicting document similarity. A TF-IDF model and a model utilizing Spacy's internal similarity tools were far less performant.

For the final output of this project, I have created two files:
* 'texts_processed.csv': a final csv file of all relevant information, including the columns of names, distinct names, dates and datetime objects.
* 'closest_matches.csv': a sampling of the top five articles in similarity to the sample article, using the Sentence Embedding method.

## Ingesting and Analyzing Dataset

The source dataset was provided by Deloitte, as a csv file of unstructured text data from several news articles.

      <td>A ship with supplies for Gaza will dock at el-Arish in Egypt, officials say, after Israeli pressure to stop the vessel breaking its Gaza blockade. The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a "blacklist" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry "a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people".</td>

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. "Mel was really important to Ed," an agency source said. "He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son." But he added, "The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion." Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. "I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him," one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.</td>

It seems as though much of the information in the dataset is not useful for the purpose of this project. I will simplify the dataframe through selecting relevant columns:
* 'article': the title of each article
* 'oururl': the url of the article's text
* 'newdescp': the basic text of each article


```python
# Keeping only relevant columns
keepcols = ['article', 'oururl', 'newdescp']
text_simple = text_df[keepcols]
```

# Part 1: Name and Date Recognition

## Name Recognition

To identify names within the text of each article, I will utilize two external libraries:
* Spacy: Used to tokenize the data into sentences. Selected for fast and accurate performance.
* Flair: Used to tokenize spans within each sentence. Selected for its highly intuitive understanding of the context of tokens and token spans.

After identifying a list of names, I will create an additional column containing only distinct names.

**Note:** I considered removing all single-word names such as "Ghadafi," since many are duplicates of the first/last names located within the article. However, simply removing these names could eliminate important information such as people referred to only by last name. For this reason, I left the list as-is.


```python
# Downloading named entity recognition model
tagger = SequenceTagger.load('ner')

# Creating spacy tokenizer for parsing sentences
nlp = spacy.load('en')
tokenizer = build_spacy_tokenizer(nlp)

# Defining function for tagging named entities in text
def find_names(text):
    # Creating empty list for name tokens
    names = []
    sentences = [Sentence(sent, use_tokenizer=tokenizer) for sent in split_single(text)]
    tagger.predict(sentences)
    for sent in sentences:
        for entity in sent.get_spans('ner'):
            if entity.tag=='PER':
                names.append(entity.text)
            else:
                pass
    return names
```

"The Guardian Council is ready to recount randomly up to 10 percent of ballot boxes in last week's disputed presidential election," the council's spokesman Abbas Ali Kadkhodai was quoted as saying. "The Guardian Council is not legally obliged," Kadkhodai said, "we will recount the votes in the presence of the three (defeated) candidates." Whenever the examination and the recount is finished the council will announce its final decision, he added. He also said that Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi still have time to express their opinions until Wednesday.

Iran's former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and former Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karroubi failed to attend the meeting without giving any reason. The Spokesman of the Guardian Council Abbas-Ali Kadkhodaei said on Wednesday that candidates of Iran's recent presidential election were invited to its upcoming meeting session which is to be held within the next few days. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei has ordered Iran's Guardian Council, the top legislative body, to investigate the claims of "fraud" in the recent presidential election.</td>

```python
# Removing duplicates from name list
text_simple['names_distinct'] = text_simple['names'].apply(lambda x: list(set(x))).copy()
```

## Results

Overall, the results of the text recognition seem very reliable. This process took a significant amount of compute power and processing time. In the future, I would experiment with implementing this process on a Spark cluster to increase compute power.

## Date Recognition

Next, I will parse each article to remove any relevant date information. I will do this in two steps:
* Use Spacy's tagging function to identify any date-related words, placing those words in a list within a new column.
* Converting all date-related words in the column to datetime objects, if possible. This should help with future useability of the date information.


```python
# Defining function to detect dates in text
def date_detect(string):
    # Creating tagged doc from string
    doc = nlp(string)
    # Create empty list of dates
    date_list = []
    # Detecting date using spacy libraray
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_=='DATE':
            # append date to list
            date_list.append(ent.text)
        else:
            pass
    return date_list
```


```python
# Applying function to text and creating column of dates
text_simple['dates'] = text_simple['newdescp'].apply(date_detect).copy()
```


```python
# Define function to apply timefhuman for readable timestamp objects
def timestamp(timelist):
    output = []
    for i in timelist:
        try:
            output.append(timefhuman(i))
        # Exception handling for non readable dates
        except Exception:
            pass
    # Removing empty items
    output = list(filter(None, output))
    return output
```


```python
# Applying function to text and creating column of datetime objects
text_simple['datetimes'] = text_simple['dates'].apply(timestamp).copy()
```


```python

## Results

After the data processing, we have several new columns of relevant data:
* 'names': a list containing all personal names detected in the article
* 'names_distinct': a list of all distinct names detected
* 'dates': a list of all date-type strings detected
* 'datetimes': a list of datetime objects for any detectable timestamps

**Note:** The datetime objects could be more accurate if each article had a corresponding date of publication. This could allow the library to index those dates such as "last week" or "next Tuesday" to specific timestamps. From the given data, we might have been able to use the `'last_judgement_at'` column, but without documentation we cannot tell if this is an appopriate reference date to use.

# Part 2: Check for Document Similarity

For part two of this assessment, we will scan the news articles to find those most similar to a provided sample. To do this, we will try a few machine learning techniques:
* "Term Frequency - Inverse Document Freqency" (TF-IDF) with a cosine similarity test
* Sentence Emedding with Google Sentence Encoder
* Spacy Vectorization - using Spacy's internal vectorization and similariy function

## Preprocessing
To begin, we need to preprocess the data in order to:
* Lowercase all words
* Remove stop words
* Remove puntuation
* Remove single characters (unneeeded for our analysis)
* Stem each word
* Lemmatize each word
* Convert numbers to words

### Creating Preprocessing Functions


```python
# Function to lowercase all words
def convert_lower_case(text):
    return np.char.lower(text)
```


```python
# Function to remove stop words
def remove_stop_words(text):
    stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
    words = word_tokenize(str(text))
    new_text = ""
    for w in words:
        if w not in stop_words and len(w) > 1:
            new_text = new_text + " " + w
    return new_text
```


```python
# Function to remove punctuation
def remove_punctuation(text):
    symbols = "!\"#$%&()*+-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~\n"
    for i in range(len(symbols)):
        text = np.char.replace(text, symbols[i], ' ')
        text = np.char.replace(text, " ", " ")
    text = np.char.replace(text, ',', '')
    return text
```


```python
# Function to remove apostrophes
# We call this function separately to avoid erros in possessive words
def remove_apostrophe(text):
    return np.char.replace(text, "'", '')
```


```python
# Function to stem words
def stemming(text):
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
    tokens = word_tokenize(str(text))
    new_text = ""
    for w in tokens:
        new_text = new_text + " " + stemmer.stem(w)
    return new_text
```


```python
# Function to convert numbers to text
def convert_numbers(text):
    tokens = word_tokenize(str(text))
    new_text = ""
    for w in tokens:
        try:
            w = num2words(int(w))
        except:
            a = 0
        new_text = new_text + " " + w
    new_text = np.char.replace(new_text, "-", " ")
    return new_text
```


```python
# Function to preprocess data using previously defined functions
def preprocess(text):
    text = convert_lower_case(text)
    text = remove_punctuation(text)
    text = remove_apostrophe(text)
    text = remove_stop_words(text)
    text = convert_numbers(text)
    text = stemming(text)
    text = remove_punctuation(text)
    text = convert_numbers(text)
    text = stemming(text)
    text = remove_punctuation(text) # needed again as num2word adds some hyphens and commas
    text = remove_stop_words(text) # needed again as num2word adds some stop words
    return text
```


```python
# Applying preprocessing function to all articles
text_simple['processed_text'] = text_simple['newdescp'].apply(preprocess).copy()

Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. "Mel was really important to Ed," an agency source said. "He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son." But he added, "The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion." Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. "I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him," one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.</td>

      <td>Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability. Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. "Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say." The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, "We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before." Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.</td>

      <td>The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent. Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. "The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings." Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, "Down with the regime" and "Get out Muammar Gaddafi." Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon "nationalist youth" to go out and "defend national symbols." At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.</td>

      <td>Flu viruses which target man tend to attach to cells further up the airway - maximising their chances of being passed on by coughing or sneezing. Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.</td>

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. "I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu," Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as "stable", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.</td>

      <td>Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability. Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. "Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say." The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, "We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before." Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.</td>

      <td>The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent. Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings. (New York) - The Libyan security forces killed at least 24 protesters and wounded many others in a crackdown on peaceful demonstrations across the country, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should cease the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary to protect lives and open an independent investigation into the lethal shootings, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of peaceful protesters took to the streets on February 17, 2011, in Baida, Benghazy, Zenten, Derna, and Ajdabiya. According to multiple witnesses, Libyan security forces shot and killed the demonstrators in efforts to disperse the protests. "The security forces' vicious attacks on peaceful demonstrators lay bare the reality of Muammar Gaddafi's brutality when faced with any internal dissent," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Libyans should not have to risk their lives to make a stand for their rights as human beings." Some of the worst violence was in the eastern city of Baida. At around 1 p.m. on February 17, according to sources in Libya, hospital staff put out a call for additional medical supplies, as they became overwhelmed with the medical needs of 70 injured protesters, half of them in critical condition due to gunshot wounds. On the night of February 16, security forces had attacked peaceful protesters with teargas and live ammunition, shooting dead two protesters, according to protesters who spoke to Human Rights Watch. Geneva-based Libya Human Rights Solidarity has confirmed three of the names of those shot dead so far: Safwan Attiya, Nasser Al Juweigi, and Ahmad El Qabili. One protester told Human Rights Watch that a new protest started on February 17, after noon prayers and the funerals of those killed on February 16. Joined by hundreds of other protesters, families marched toward the Internal Security office, chanting, "Down with the regime" and "Get out Muammar Gaddafi." Some protesters filmed the protests with mobile phones and posted them online. One injured protester in a hospital in Baida told Human Rights Watch that he was sitting near the intensive care unit there and had confirmed that security forces had shot dead 16 people and wounded dozens of others. He said that Special Forces and armed men in street clothes fired live ammunition to deter protesters. A protester in Benghazi told Human Rights Watch that hundreds of lawyers, activists, and other protesters gathered on the steps of the Benghazi Court calling for a constitution and respect for the rule of law. Early in the day, sources in Libya told Human Rights Watch that security forces had arrested a Benghazi journalist, Hind El Houny, and Salem Souidan, a family member of a group that has been seeking justice for the massacre of inmates in Abu Salim prison in 1996. Security forces also arrested a former political prisoner, Abdel Nasser al-Rabbasi, in Bani Walid. The protester said he saw groups of men in street clothes armed with knives, later joined by Internal Security forces, charging the protesters to disperse them. The protester told Human Rights Watch that he believed security forces had shot dead at least 17 protesters during the day, mostly near Abdel Nasser Street. Human Rights Watch was able to confirm eight of those deaths. It appears that the government also has coordinated pro-government supporters to confront the demonstrations. On February 16, subscribers to Libyana, one of two Libyan mobile phone networks, received a text message calling upon "nationalist youth" to go out and "defend national symbols." At around 11:30 p.m. on February 17, a protester in Tripoli told Human Rights Watch that anti-government protests had started in Tripoli also.</td>

      <td>Flu viruses which target man tend to attach to cells further up the airway - maximising their chances of being passed on by coughing or sneezing. Researchers found the bird flu virus attaches itself to cells deep down in the human airways. The University of Wisconsin research is published in the journal Nature. But it still cannot jump easily from human to human. Scientists fear that if it mutates and gains that ability, it could result in a human flu pandemic, with millions of deaths world-wide. The Wisconsin team investigated why the virus could not spread easily between humans despite the fact that it could replicate efficiently in human lungs. Flu viruses infecting humans and birds are known to home in on slightly different versions of the same molecule, found on the surface of cells which line the respiratory tract. The latest study found the version of the molecule targeted by human viruses was more prevalent on cells higher up in the airway. The molecule targeted by bird viruses, on the other hand, tended to be found on cells deep within the lungs, in structures called alveoli. Thus the bird flu virus tended to be buried so deep in the lungs that it was unlikely to be spread by coughing or sneezing.</td>

At least 58 people showed symptoms, which include high fever, nausea and vomiting, during June and July. The World Health Organization has urged calm, saying the disease is unable to spread from human to human. "I can assure you that the disease is absolutely not Sars, anthrax or bird flu," Zeng Huajin, a Sichuan health official, told the China Daily newspaper. The number of people infected with the illness has risen steadily as health officials searched through remote villages in the province for people with symptoms. A total of 17 people have died, with just two discharged from hospital. Twelve people remain in a critical condition while 27 are described as "stable", doctors said. Health officials said the illness could be a variant of the streptococcus bacteria, often found in pigs. The symptoms cannot be spread from human to human, and those most at risk from animal carcasses are people with vulnerable, low immune systems, officials said. Experts had expressed fears that pigs, which can also carry human influenza, could accelerate mutation of the bird flu virus into a form which can be transmitted between people.</td>

      <td>The U.N. Human Rights Council decried a wide range of human rights violations in Syria on Friday and called for U.N. bodies to consider a recent report detailing the abuses and take" appropriate action." The council passed a resolution that "strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children." There were 37 yes votes, four against and six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a troubling report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces "committed crimes against humanity" against civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies "urgently consider" the commission report and "take appropriate action." The group decided to send the Commission of Inquiry report to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon "for appropriate action and transmission to all U.N. relevant bodies." It backs "efforts to protect the population of the Syrian Arab Republic and to bring an immediate end to gross human rights violations." And, it urged Syria "to protect its population" and "to immediately put an end to all human rights violations." The resolution also decided "to establish a mandate of a Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Syria and urges Syria to cooperate with it. Before the resolution was adopted, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay told the council Syria faces a "full-fledged civil war" if the regime's "continual ruthless repression" against peaceful demonstrators and civilians isn't stopped now. She noted with concern the reports of "increased armed attacks by the opposition forces, including the so-called Free Syrian army, against the Syrian military and security apparatus." "In light of the manifest failure of the Syrian authorities to protect their citizens, the international community needs to take urgent and effective measures to protect the Syrian people," Pillay said.</td>

### Test 1: Results

From exploring the top 5 articles by cosine similarity, it seems that articles 1, 2 and 5 have a good deal of contextual overlap. These artciles refer to protests and human rights abuses in Libya and Syria, while the sample text is about human rights abuses from protests in Egypt.

However, articles 3 and 4 are related mainly to viruses and have nothing to do protests, human rights, or the middle east. Further similarity testing is needed to refine results.

## Test 2: Sentence Embedding

For this test, we will utilize the Google Sentence Encoder. This encoder uses embeddings for words within larger sentence structures which are averaged together and given an embedding for the overall sentence. These larger embeddings are compared for correlation.

Because this model utilizes sentence structure, we will use the raw text from each article rather than its cleaned and tokenized version.


```python
# Import module from Universal Sentence Encoder
module_url = "https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4" #@param ["https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/4", "https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5"]
model = hub.load(module_url)

         Human Rights Watch says government-controlled health services in Egypt have been pressured into playing down the number of casualties during anti-government protests. The group has documented the deaths of 297 people, but says the final toll is likely to be significantly higher. Human Rights Watch says the vast majority of the deaths in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez were on January 28 and 29 as a result of live gunfire as riot police fought running battles with protesters. A significant proportion came as a result of rubber bullets fired at too close a range and from teargas canisters fired into the crowds at very close range. Human Rights Watch says the actual number of deaths is likely to be an underestimate because the organisation had only included those deaths it had verified itself at key hospitals in the three major cities.

      <td>At least 24 people have been killed in anti-government protests in Libya in recent days, rights activists say. Many others were wounded in the clashes between security forces and protesters, the US-based Human Rights Watch said. Protests continued overnight with thousands on the streets of the eastern city of Benghazi, where there is now a heavy military presence, witnesses said. Large protests are uncommon in Libya, where dissent is rarely allowed. Pro-democracy protests have recently swept through several Arab nations, with the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt forced from power amid growing unrest. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says violent confrontations are reported to have spread to five Libyan cities in demonstrations so far, but not yet to Tripoli, the capital, in any large numbers. Our correspondent says the reports reflect an extremely tough government response, including the use of gunfire and even denying supplies to hospitals. Funerals of some of those killed are expected to be held on Friday in Benghazi and al-Bayda, which correspondents say could spur more protests. Activists set up camps in al-Bayda after Thursday's "Day of Rage" protest against the government, witnesses said. Eyewitnesses believe that the death toll could be even higher, our correspondent says.</td>

      <td>(CNN) -- Yemeni protesters and military and pro-government gangs clashed in several areas Tuesday, with at least six killed and hundreds more injured, as the future of President Ali Abdullah Saleh remained uncertain. The United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the "real threat" from al Qaeda in the country, he said. In Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base. Four people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said. "The government forces are killing us," said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. "Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts." In the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds. The security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators. "Security forces did not attack protesters," said Abdullah Qiaran. "We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing." An estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said. The violence comes as the United States is helping to mediate a transition out of office for Saleh, who has been facing popular protests for weeks, according to two Yemeni officials.</td>

      <td>1 of 13. Anti-government protesters run after police fired tear gas during a demonstration in the southern Yemeni city of Taiz April 4, 2011. The attempt to suppress mounting protests inspired by uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia came amid signs that the United States is seeking an end to Saleh's 32-year rule, long seen as a rampart against Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In Taiz, south of the capital Sanaa, police shot at protesters trying to storm the provincial government building, killing at least 15 and wounding 30, hospital doctors said. "The regime has surprised us with this extent of killing. I don't think the people will do anything other than come out with bare chests to drain the government of all its ammunition," parliamentarian Mohammed Muqbil al-Hamiri told Al Jazeera TV. The television showed a row of men, apparent tear gas victims, lying motionless and being tended by medics on the carpeted floor of a makeshift hospital in Taiz. In the Red Sea port of Hudaida, police and armed men in civilian clothes attacked a march toward a presidential palace. Three people were hit by bullets, around 30 were stabbed with knifes, and 270 were hurt from inhaling tear gas, doctors said. Later on Monday, doctors said at least six demonstrators were shot dead and several wounded during evening rallies, and that the toll was likely to rise. In Washington, the U.S. State Department called the latest violence in Yemen "appalling." Yemen's opposition coalition appealed in a statement to the United Nations, human rights groups and other international bodies "to intervene quickly to stop President Saleh and his entourage from shedding more blood." As opposition forces stepped up their actions, Saleh again appeared defiant.</td>

### Test 2: Results

The results of the sentence encoder seem much more promising. Overall, all five articles share many similarities. They all refer to violent protests, and all are located somewhere in the Middle East/North Africa region (Egypt, Libya, Yemen). Several refer to human rights issues and anti-government protests, much like the sample article.

The results of this test seem far more accurate than the cosine similarity test.

## Test 3: Spacy Vectorization

Finally, we will run a similarity test using Spacy's internal similarity function. This model vectorizes the sample and article texts using spacy's nlp vectorizer utilized above. It then compares similarity in both directions (sample->test, test->sample) and averages the similarity score.

For this test, we will utilize the tokenized and cleaned version of the article text.


```python
# Defining function to use spacy's vectorizer
def spacy_test(string):
    # Checking to make sure each value contains information
    if string:
        # Storing sample article and string, vectorizing using spacy nlp
        sample = nlp('''
             Human Rights Watch says government-controlled health services in Egypt have been pressured into playing down the number of casualties during anti-government protests. The group has documented the deaths of 297 people, but says the final toll is likely to be significantly higher. Human Rights Watch says the vast majority of the deaths in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez were on January 28 and 29 as a result of live gunfire as riot police fought running battles with protesters. A significant proportion came as a result of rubber bullets fired at too close a range and from teargas canisters fired into the crowds at very close range. Human Rights Watch says the actual number of deaths is likely to be an underestimate because the organisation had only included those deaths it had verified itself at key hospitals in the three major cities.
             ''')
        testdoc = nlp(string)
        # Testing for similarity in both directions
        similarity = sample.similarity(testdoc)
        similarity_rev = testdoc.similarity(sample)
        # Averaging both similarity scores
        sim_score = (similarity + similarity_rev) / 2
    else:
        pass
    return sim_score
```


```python
# Applying spacy vectorization test to all articles
text_simple['spacy_test'] = text_simple['processed_text'].apply(spacy_test).copy()

      <td>The troubled Vancouver Olympics continued to be hit with bad news on Saturday, as the men's downhill skiing event was postponed due to the continuing unsuitable weather. Rain and high temperatures have made the course too slushy for racers to ski down, meaning the opening Alpine event of the 2010 Winter Olympics must take place another time. The women's super-combined event due to be held on Sunday was already postponed on Friday, and now the opening men's event has been shelved with no new date yet released, but they will most probably try for Monday. The build-up to the Games had been plagued by poor weather, with rain, fog and high temperatures causing a slushy slope much too dangerous to race on. Organisers have even had to ship in snow from higher ground as warm temperatures threaten to badly disrupt the Olympic schedule, and already they are two days behind in the skiing. International Ski Federation race director Gunter Hujara said that the piste was unacceptable for high speed racing after yet more unsuitable weather. "The piste has been badly affected these last two days by the mild temperatures and the humid conditions with snow and rain," Hujara said. Conditions are expected to improve on Monday when officials will most probably try and get the men's downhill in progress, but it is more bad publicity that Vancouver chiefs could do without after a troubled and tragic start.</td>

I'm afraid it will not be over in the next two quarters." "A major drop began in October and there will also be drops in November-December," he said, according to official reports. Recessions are normally declared after two quarters of negative growth. He also said that full-year economic growth for 2008 would be lower than the 6.8% previously forecast. Russia - reliant on metals and oil - has been hit by tumbling oil prices and falling demand for commodities Its economy grew by 8.1% in 2007, helped by soaring oil and metals prices. The price of oil hit a high of $147 a barrel earlier this year, but it is now languishing below $50. Russia's stock markets have plunged in recent months and the central bank has spent billions of dollars trying to support the rouble.</td>

      <td>Activists say more than 250 Syrians have been killed so far this month as the political unrest escalates dramatically. Less than two weeks in, November is shaping up to be one of the bloodiest months yet in Syria's eight-month-old uprising. The Local Coordination Committees activist network says 250 Syrians have been killed since the start of the month. Most of the dead are civilians, and about 20 are soldiers. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also documented more than 200 civilian deaths. But the observatory has a far higher toll for soldiers, saying more than 100 were killed. The differing death tolls could not be immediately reconciled. But the startling figures point to the spike in violence recently.</td>

      <td>In a ruling commendable for its readability as well as its cogent reasoning, King County Superior Court Judge William Downing has presented the Washington Supreme Court with the sound legal foundation for allowing same-sex marriage. Downing's summary judgment yesterday found the state's 1998 Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as "a union between a man and a woman" to be an unconstitutional denial of civil liberties. Much of the remarkably weak case presented by the defendants -- including the state, King County and Sen. Val Stevens -- rested on a link between civil marriage and the production of children. "The legal question is not whether heterosexual marriage is good for the replenishment of the species. It is," Downing wrote. "The precise question is whether barring committed same-sex couples from the benefits of the civil marriage laws somehow serves the interest of encouraging procreation. There is no logical way in which it does." Neither Downing's nor the state high court's ultimate ruling will impinge on religious practices. The issue is civil marriages. Among citations in support of his decision, Downing notes the state constitution's provision that "no law shall be passed granting any citizen [or] class of citizens ... privileges or immunities which upon the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens ... " The high court would demonstrate similar wisdom -- and valor -- by quickly affirming Downing's ruling.</td>

### Test 3 Results

This test required a significant amount more compute power than the others, and its results are comparatively diappointing. The articles seem to be focused on the Vancouver Olympics, a Russian recession, an Indian election, and a same-sex marriage case. One article is more closely related, describing unrest in Syria.

On the whole, this model seems to be the least accurate.

# Part 2: Results

After processing the text using three separate tools, it seems that the Sentence Encoding test provides the most accurate result.

# Outputting Final Results to Files

Finally, I will output two files:
* 'texts_processed.csv': a final csv file of all relevant information, including the columns of names, distinct names, dates and datetime objects.
* 'closest_matches.csv': a sampling of the top five articles in similarity to the sample article, using the Sentence Embedding method.


```python
text_simple.to_csv('texts_processed.csv')
sentence_samples.to_csv('closest_matches.csv')
```
