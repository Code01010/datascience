Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna.

""Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say.""

Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi.

2625,"Libya protests leave 24 dead, says rights group",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)," At least 24 people have been killed in anti-government protests in Libya in recent days, rights activists say. Many others were wounded in the clashes between security forces and protesters, the US-based Human Rights Watch said. Protests continued overnight with thousands on the streets of the eastern city of Benghazi, where there is now a heavy military presence, witnesses said. Large protests are uncommon in Libya, where dissent is rarely allowed. Pro-democracy protests have recently swept through several Arab nations, with the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt forced from power amid growing unrest. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says violent confrontations are reported to have spread to five Libyan cities in demonstrations so far, but not yet to Tripoli, the capital, in any large numbers. Our correspondent says the reports reflect an extremely tough government response, including the use of gunfire and even denying supplies to hospitals. Funerals of some of those killed are expected to be held on Friday in Benghazi and al-Bayda, which correspondents say could spur more protests. Activists set up camps in al-Bayda after Thursday's ""Day of Rage"" protest against the government, witnesses said. Eyewitnesses believe that the death toll could be even higher, our correspondent says.",0.691777229309082
638,"Hundreds hurt, 6 killed in Yemen violence",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution," (CNN) -- Yemeni protesters and military and pro-government gangs clashed in several areas Tuesday, with at least six killed and hundreds more injured, as the future of President Ali Abdullah Saleh remained uncertain. The United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the ""real threat"" from al Qaeda in the country, he said. In Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base. Four people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said. ""The government forces are killing us,"" said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. ""Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts."" In the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds. The security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators. ""Security forces did not attack protesters,"" said Abdullah Qiaran. ""We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing."" An estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said.

Anti-government protesters run after police fired tear gas during a demonstration in the southern Yemeni city of Taiz April 4, 2011. The attempt to suppress mounting protests inspired by uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia came amid signs that the United States is seeking an end to Saleh's 32-year rule, long seen as a rampart against Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In Taiz, south of the capital Sanaa, police shot at protesters trying to storm the provincial government building, killing at least 15 and wounding 30, hospital doctors said. ""The regime has surprised us with this extent of killing. I don't think the people will do anything other than come out with bare chests to drain the government of all its ammunition,"" parliamentarian Mohammed Muqbil al-Hamiri told Al Jazeera TV. The television showed a row of men, apparent tear gas victims, lying motionless and being tended by medics on the carpeted floor of a makeshift hospital in Taiz. In the Red Sea port of Hudaida, police and armed men in civilian clothes attacked a march toward a presidential palace. Three people were hit by bullets, around 30 were stabbed with knifes, and 270 were hurt from inhaling tear gas, doctors said. Later on Monday, doctors said at least six demonstrators were shot dead and several wounded during evening rallies, and that the toll was likely to rise.
