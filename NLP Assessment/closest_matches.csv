The two killed were shot by police trying to disperse angry crowds in the city of Suez, medical officials said. In the capital Cairo, thousands of protesters remained on the streets following a day of clashes with police. Thousands marched to the interior ministry, where security forces fired tear gas to keep them back. Earlier, the Egyptian prime minister announced the sackings of several senior officials. Funerals of some of the 74 victims took place in Port Said, where the football match had taken place on Wednesday. The deaths came when fans invaded the pitch after a fixture between top Cairo club al-Ahly and the Port Said side al-Masry. As night fell in Cairo, several thousand demonstrators remained in the streets around the interior ministry, witnesses said. In Suez, health official Mohammed Lasheen said two people had been shot dead early on Friday.

1,2361,Libya: Security Forces Kill 84 Over Three Days,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)," Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability. Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say. (New York) - Government security forces have killed at least 84 people in three days of protests in several cities in Libya, Human Rights Watch said today, based on telephone interviews with local hospital staff and witnesses. The Libyan authorities should immediately end attacks on peaceful protesters and protect them from assault by pro-government armed groups, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of demonstrators gathered in the eastern Libyan cities of Benghazi, Baida, Ajdabiya, Zawiya, and Derna on February 18, 2011, following violent attacks against peaceful protests the day before that killed 20 people in Benghazi, 23 in Baida, three in Ajdabiya, and three in Derna. Hospital sources told Human Rights Watch that security forces killed 35 people in Benghazi on February 18, almost all with live ammunition. ""Muammar Gaddafi's security forces are firing on Libyan citizens and killing scores simply because they're demanding change and accountability,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""Libyan authorities should allow peaceful protesters to have their say."" The protests in Benghazi on February 18 began during funerals for the 20 demonstrators killed by security forces the day before. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that security forces with distinctive yellow uniforms opened fire on protesters near the Fadil Bu Omar Katiba, a security force base in the center of Benghazi. One protester told Human Rights Watch he witnessed four men shot dead. By 11 p.m. on February 18, Al Jalaa Hospital in Benghazi had received the bodies of 35 people killed that day, a senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch. He said the deaths had been caused by gunshot wounds to the chest, neck, and head. Two sources at the hospital confirmed to Human Rights Watch that the death toll for February 17 was 20, and that at least 45 people had been wounded by bullets. The senior hospital official told Human Rights Watch, ""We put out a call to all the doctors in Benghazi to come to the hospital and for everyone to contribute blood because I've never seen anything like this before."" Witnesses said that after the February 18 shootings, protesters in Benghazi continued on to the courthouse and gathered there throughout the evening, the crowd swelling to thousands. In Baida, further to the east, protesters on February 18 buried the 23 people who had been shot dead the day before. One protester told Human Rights Watch that police were patrolling the streets but he had seen no further clashes.","['Muammar Gaddafi', 'Muammar Gaddafi', 'Joe Stork']","['three days', 'today', 'February 18, 2011', 'the day', 'February 18', 'February 18', 'the day before', 'February 18', 'that day', 'February 17', '20', 'February 18', 'February 18', 'the day before']","[datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 21, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2011, 2, 18, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 17, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 21, 20, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 2, 18, 0, 0)]","['Muammar Gaddafi', 'Joe Stork']", muammar gaddafi secur forc fire libyan citizen kill score simpli theyr demand chang account libyan author allow peac protest say new york govern secur forc kill least eighti four peopl three day protest sever citi libya human right watch said today base telephon interview local hospit staff wit libyan author immedi end attack peac protest protect assault pro govern arm group human right watch said thousand demonstr gather eastern libyan citi benghazi baida ajdabiya zawiya derna februari eighteen two thousand eleven follow violent attack peac protest day kill twenti peopl benghazi twenti three baida three ajdabiya three derna hospit sourc told human right watch secur forc kill thirti five peopl benghazi februari eighteen almost live ammunit muammar gaddafi secur forc fire libyan citizen kill score simpli theyr demand chang account said joe stork deputi middl east north africa director human right watch libyan author allow peac protest say protest benghazi februari eighteen began funer twenti demonstr kill secur forc day eyewit told human right watch secur forc distinct yellow uniform open fire protest near fadil bu omar katiba secur forc base center benghazi one protest told human right watch wit four men shot dead eleven februari eighteen al jalaa hospit benghazi receiv bodi thirti five peopl kill day senior hospit offici told human right watch said death cau gunshot wound chest neck head two sourc hospit confirm human right watch death toll februari seventeen twenti least forti five peopl wound bullet senior hospit offici told human right watch put call doctor benghazi come hospit everyon contribut blood ive never seen anyth like wit said februari eighteen shoot protest benghazi continu courthou gather throughout even crowd swell thousand baida east protest februari eighteen buri twenti three peopl shot dead day one protest told human right watch polic patrol street seen clash,0.10260998243792133,0.6978631019592285,0.8777403862534898
29,2625,"Libya protests leave 24 dead, says rights group",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Civil_War_(2011)," At least 24 people have been killed in anti-government protests in Libya in recent days, rights activists say. Many others were wounded in the clashes between security forces and protesters, the US-based Human Rights Watch said. Protests continued overnight with thousands on the streets of the eastern city of Benghazi, where there is now a heavy military presence, witnesses said. Large protests are uncommon in Libya, where dissent is rarely allowed. Pro-democracy protests have recently swept through several Arab nations, with the presidents of Tunisia and Egypt forced from power amid growing unrest. The BBC's Jon Leyne in Cairo says violent confrontations are reported to have spread to five Libyan cities in demonstrations so far, but not yet to Tripoli, the capital, in any large numbers. Our correspondent says the reports reflect an extremely tough government response, including the use of gunfire and even denying supplies to hospitals. Funerals of some of those killed are expected to be held on Friday in Benghazi and al-Bayda, which correspondents say could spur more protests. Activists set up camps in al-Bayda after Thursday's ""Day of Rage"" protest against the government, witnesses said.

873,638,"Hundreds hurt, 6 killed in Yemen violence",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution," (CNN) -- Yemeni protesters and military and pro-government gangs clashed in several areas Tuesday, with at least six killed and hundreds more injured, as the future of President Ali Abdullah Saleh remained uncertain. The United States has no intention of stopping its military aid to Yemen, despite the unrest, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Tuesday. The aid, in support of Yemeni counterterrorism efforts, continues to be essential because of the ""real threat"" from al Qaeda in the country, he said. In Sanaa, the capital, eyewitnesses and field medical teams told CNN that security forces and anti-riot police used batons to attack protesters among 40,000 people marching on Zubairy Street Tuesday evening. In addition, pro-government gangs attacked protesters on Tuesday near a military base. Four people were killed -- three pro-government demonstrators and one anti-government demonstrator. Windows were shattered on an ambulance carrying some of the 56 injured protesters to a hospital, witnesses said. ""The government forces are killing us,"" said Abdullah Salem, a youth activist who was at the protest. ""Saleh and his militia will not succeed, and every blood spilt will be accounted for in international courts."" In the city of Taiz, meanwhile, at least two anti-government protesters were killed when security forces and Republican Guards fired on protesters, according to medical teams. Hundreds of people were injured, 55 of them from gunshot wounds. The security chief in Taiz denied his forces fired on demonstrators. ""Security forces did not attack protesters,"" said Abdullah Qiaran. ""We were dispersing pro and anti-government protesters after we saw that both sides were clashing."" An estimated 30,000 demonstrators marched near the presidential palace in the port city of Hodeida Tuesday evening, witnesses said. The violence comes as the United States is helping to mediate a transition out of office for Saleh, who has been facing popular protests for weeks, according to two Yemeni officials.","['Ali Abdullah Saleh', 'Geoff Morrell', 'Abdullah Salem', 'Saleh', 'Abdullah Qiaran', 'Saleh']","['Tuesday', 'Tuesday', 'Tuesday', 'Tuesday', 'Tuesday', 'weeks']","[datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 24, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 24, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 24, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 24, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 24, 0, 0)]","['Abdullah Qiaran', 'Saleh', 'Ali Abdullah Saleh', 'Geoff Morrell', 'Abdullah Salem']", cnn yemeni protest militari pro govern gang clash sever area tuesday least six kill hundr injur futur presid ali abdullah saleh remain uncertain unit state intent stop militari aid yemen despit unrest pentagon spokesman geoff morrel said tuesday aid support yemeni counterterror effort continu essenti real threat al qaeda countri said sanaa capit eyewit field medic team told cnn secur forc anti riot polic use baton attack protest among forti thousand peopl march zubairi street tuesday even addit pro govern gang attack protest tuesday near militari base four peopl kill three pro govern demonstr one anti govern demonstr window shatter ambul carri fifti six injur protest hospit wit said govern forc kill us said abdullah salem youth activist protest saleh militia succeed everi blood spilt account intern court citi taiz meanwhil least two anti govern protest kill secur forc republican guard fire protest accord medic team hundr peopl injur fifti five gunshot wound secur chief taiz deni forc fire demonstr secur forc attack protest said abdullah qiaran disper pro anti govern protest saw side clash estim thirti thousand demonstr march near presidenti palac port citi hodeida tuesday even wit said violenc come unit state help mediat transit offic saleh face popular protest week accord two yemeni offici,0.0136525927882423,0.6878506541252136,0.8165932257855648
161,804,Yemen toll rises as U.S. seen pressing Saleh to go,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemeni_Revolution," 1 of 13. Anti-government protesters run after police fired tear gas during a demonstration in the southern Yemeni city of Taiz April 4, 2011. The attempt to suppress mounting protests inspired by uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia came amid signs that the United States is seeking an end to Saleh's 32-year rule, long seen as a rampart against Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In Taiz, south of the capital Sanaa, police shot at protesters trying to storm the provincial government building, killing at least 15 and wounding 30, hospital doctors said. ""The regime has surprised us with this extent of killing. I don't think the people will do anything other than come out with bare chests to drain the government of all its ammunition,"" parliamentarian Mohammed Muqbil al-Hamiri told Al Jazeera TV. The television showed a row of men, apparent tear gas victims, lying motionless and being tended by medics on the carpeted floor of a makeshift hospital in Taiz. In the Red Sea port of Hudaida, police and armed men in civilian clothes attacked a march toward a presidential palace. Three people were hit by bullets, around 30 were stabbed with knifes, and 270 were hurt from inhaling tear gas, doctors said. Later on Monday, doctors said at least six demonstrators were shot dead and several wounded during evening rallies, and that the toll was likely to rise. In Washington, the U.S. State Department called the latest violence in Yemen ""appalling."" Yemen's opposition coalition appealed in a statement to the United Nations, human rights groups and other international bodies ""to intervene quickly to stop President Saleh and his entourage from shedding more blood."" As opposition forces stepped up their actions, Saleh again appeared defiant.","['Saleh', 'Mohammed Muqbil al', 'Hamiri', 'Saleh', 'Saleh']","['April 4, 2011', 'march', 'Monday']","[datetime.datetime(2011, 4, 4, 0, 0), datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 23, 0, 0)]","['Hamiri', 'Saleh', 'Mohammed Muqbil al']", thirteen anti govern protest run polic fire tear ga demonstr southern yemeni citi taiz april two thousand eleven attempt suppress mount protest inspir upri egypt tunisia came amid sign unit state seek end saleh thirti two year rule long seen rampart yemen base al qaeda arabian peninsula taiz south capit sanaa polic shot protest tri storm provinci govern build kill least fifteen wound thirti hospit doctor said regim surpri us extent kill dont think peopl anyth come bare chest drain govern ammunit parliamentarian moham muqbil al hamiri told al jazeera tv televi show row men appar tear ga victim lie motionless tend medic carpet floor makeshift hospit taiz red sea port hudaida polic arm men civilian cloth attack march toward presidenti palac three peopl hit bullet around thirti stab knife two hundr seventi hurt inhal tear ga doctor said later monday doctor said least six demonstr shot dead sever wound even ralli toll like rise washington state depart call latest violenc yemen appal yemen opposit coalit appeal statement unit nation human right group intern bodi interven quickli stop presid saleh entourag shed blood opposit forc step action saleh appear defiant,0.028330477112336168,0.6850983500480652,0.8628256804119758
